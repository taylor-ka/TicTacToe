# TicTacToe
Create an unbeatable (?!?) tic-tac-toe bot using Java! Weâ€™ll learn about basic AI by implementing the minimax algorithm (also used to create chess bots!) and build a playable GUI!

## General lesson plan
1. Get familiar with Board class and reading Javadoc. Reminder of canWin method from lecture, introduce minimax algorithm -- recursive backtracking! Show that 143 concepts apply to cool algorithms! Implement TicTacToeBot interface.
2. Review/finish minimax and talk about extensions like alpha-beta, etc. Talk about Model and View/Controller design pattern. Introduction to Swing, start building GUI.
3. Finish building GUI. After implementing basic functionality, students can build out new features of their choice! How to Google things effectively, read documentation, etc. Depending on time / interest, can wrap up by discussing multithreading, parallel alpha-beta for a chess bot and other optimizations like move ordering, transposition tables, etc.

## Starter code
Board.java
- Board class with Move abstraction. Depending on time, students can think about how they would design a board class / write this as well.

TicTacToeBot.java
- Interface for the bot that students will implement.

TicTacToeCLI.java
- Bare bones CLI that uses Board and implementation of TicTacToeBot. This is mostly useful for testing purposes and isn't particularly enjoyable to play. There's also no error checking whatsoever so don't mess up or the game will crash :))

## Solution code
MinimaxBot.java
- Solution code for Minimax algorithm to solve TicTacToe. Implements the TicTacToeBot interface and uses the Board class.

TicTacToeGUI.java
- Example of a possible GUI for TicTacToe. Allows player to choose what mode they want to play in, but not much functionality other than the basic game mechanics.
- Main UI components: JFrame, JButton, JOptionPane

TicTacToeMain.java
- Runs TicTacToe GUI
